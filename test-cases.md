# ledger.fec — Test Cases
*Manual browser checklist. Run locally: `python3 -m http.server 8080` from project root.*

---

## How to use this file

**Automated tests (Track 1):** Run `npx playwright test` from the project root before and after changes. 198 structural tests across all pages run in ~1 minute with mocked API. See `TESTING.md` for full details.

**Smoke tests (Track 2):** Run `npm run test:smoke` before deploys. Hits the live FEC API — 5 key checks. Requires the dev server to be running.

**Manual browser checks:** Use the checklists below for things automated tests can't verify — visual design quality, chart rendering, animation smoothness, content accuracy. Run for every page touched in a session.

**Amplitude verification method:** Open DevTools → Network tab → filter for `api2.amplitude.com`. Each event appears as a POST request. Click the request to inspect the payload and confirm event name + required properties. `Page Viewed` should fire within 2 seconds of load. Interaction events should fire only on user action, not on programmatic init calls.

**Checkboxes reset each session** — uncheck everything before starting a run. The Test log is the persistent record, not the checkboxes.

## How to maintain this file

- **New feature lands:** Add test cases in the same session it ships. New page = new section. New feature on existing page = new cases in that section.
- **Known issue resolved:** Remove from Known open issues table; add corresponding test cases to the page section.
- **Scaffold → live transition:** Expand that page's section from scaffold-scope to full coverage.
- **Test log:** Append a row for every test run. Never delete old rows — they show the testing history.

## Pre-deploy checks — clean URL pages

*Run before committing any changes to `candidate.html`, `committee.html`, or `race.html`, or when adding a new profile page. Playwright cannot catch this class of bug.*

- [ ] `styles.css` linked as `href="/styles.css"` (absolute), not `href="styles.css"` (relative)
- [ ] `main.js` linked as `src="/main.js"` (absolute)
- [ ] `utils.js` linked as `src="/utils.js"` (absolute)
- [ ] All nav links use absolute paths: `/candidates`, `/committees`, `/races`, `/search`, `/`, `/process-log.html`, `/design-system.html`
- [ ] Any outgoing links to other profile pages use clean URL format: `/candidate/{id}`, `/committee/{id}`
- [ ] race.html: sidebar logo links to `/` (not `index.html`); all nav items use `/candidates`, `/committees`, etc.

---

## Post-deploy checks (Netlify only — cannot run locally)

*These verify clean URL rewrites in `_redirects`. Run against `sloanestradley.netlify.app` after any deploy.*

- [ ] `/search` loads search.html (not 404)
- [ ] `/candidates` loads candidates.html (not 404)
- [ ] `/committees` loads committees.html (not 404)
- [ ] `/races` loads races.html (not 404)
- [ ] `/candidate/H2WA03217` loads candidate.html with MGP's profile (not 404 or blank)
- [ ] `/committee/C00744946` loads committee.html with committee data (not 404 or blank)
- [ ] `/race?state=WA&district=03&year=2024&office=H` loads race.html with candidate cards (not 404 or blank)
- [ ] Browser URL bar shows clean path (not `.html` equivalent) for all above
- [ ] Navigating to a clean URL and refreshing does not 404
